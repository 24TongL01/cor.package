Description: cor.package is an R package designed for efficient calculation of 
    correlation coefficients and matrices, along with intuitive visualization tools. 
    The package extends R's built-in cor function by adding flexible options for handling 
    missing values and computing various types of correlation coefficients. Additionally, 
    it leverages Rcpp to enhance computational performance.
